# BasicTerraria
A 2D Terraria clone. Level is randomly generated using tiles. Can hit and mine blocks. Basic functional inventory system. Made this around 2013-2014 when I was still learning Java and game development. Uses Java swing. Might try to continue project down the road, likely needs a complete rewrite. Basic controls.
